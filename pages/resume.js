                I'm a geek who
                does love "frontending" and air drumming while coding. I also like
                taking photographs here and there,
                cooking (and eating, probably even more),
                drinking way too much fine espresso coffee, singing out loud
                (even in my office, when alone),
                playing bass guitar, dancing like a fool, watching great animes,
                reading newspapers and distopic books, travelling, meeting people and discovering stuff.
