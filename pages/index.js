                My name is <strong>Alessandro Bellini</strong>. Welcome!<br />
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilmente" target="_blank">I'm a geek</a> who
                does love "frontending" and air drumming while coding. I also like
                taking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ilmente" target="_blank">photographs here and there</a>,
                cooking (and eating, probably even more),
                drinking way too much fine espresso coffee, singing out loud
                (even in my office, when alone),
                playing bass guitar, dancing like a fool, watching great animes,
                reading newspapers and distopic books, travelling, meeting people and discovering stuff.
            </p>

                I'm from Pistoia, a small town in Italy. I spend there quite some
                time, but I live and work in <strong>Berlin</strong>.
                Let's meet for a coffee if you drop by. Just let me know!
