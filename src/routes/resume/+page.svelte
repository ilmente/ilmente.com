			<h2>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a frontend enthusiast and a proper nerd. I do enjoy coding.
				<br />
				In recent years I focused mainly on frontend architecture design for ecommerce platforms. I love
				data flow and state managements, when thoroughly thought; functional and smooth UIs; solid testing,
				especialy when made easy to maintain.
				<br />
				When leading, I do invest time in building cohesive teams where everyone - me included - should
				have the time and opportunity to grow (*) as professional.
				<br />
				<small>
					* Sourceability supported me in creating a program where the team read and presented one
					book a month, during dedicated working hours. Getting paid to learn: how cool is that?
