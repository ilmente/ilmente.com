		My name is <strong>Alessandro Bellini</strong>. Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
		<br />
		I'm a geek who does love "frontending" and air drumming while coding. I also like taking photographs
		here and there, cooking (and eating, probably even more), drinking way too much fine espresso coffee,
		singing out loud (even in my office, when alone), playing bass guitar, dancing like a fool, watching
		great animes, reading newspapers and dystopian books, travelling, meeting people and discovering
		stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm from Pistoia, a small town in Italy. I spend there quite some time, but I live and work in
		Berlin. Let's meet for a coffee if you drop by.
