		My name is <strong>Alessandro Bellini</strong>. Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
		<br />
		I'm a geek who does love frontending and air drumming while coding. I also like to take photographs
		here and there, cook (and eat, probably even more), drink way too much fine espresso coffee, sing
		out loud (even in my office, when alone), pretend to be aple to play the bass guitar, dance like
		a fool, watch great animes, read newspapers and extreme mountaneering books, spend all my savings
		travelling around the world, nerd-out around watches, kink-out about backpacks, meet people and,
		generally, discover stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm from Pistoia, a small town in Italy. I spend there quite some time, but I live and work in
		Berlin. Let's meet for a coffee if you drop by.
