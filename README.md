> I'm a geek who does love "frontending" and air drumming while coding. I also like taking photographs here and there, cooking (and eating, probably even more), drinking way too much fine espresso coffee, singing out loud (even in my office, when alone), playing bass guitar, dancing like a fool, watching great animes, reading newspapers, travelling, meeting people and discovering stuff.

This is my website code repo.
